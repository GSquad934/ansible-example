All Hosts Variables
-------------------

The variables contained in these files are read for all hosts in this environment. We can find in this example two symbolic links to the *cross_vars* and *secrets_cross_vars* files + two other files for the environment's variables (one in clear-text, the other one supposedly encrypted with ansible-vault)
